# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 05, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Setup Redux and created Store, Actions and Reducer
**Link(s) to work**: [Expense Manger App](https://github.com/kk5190/expensify)

**Thoughts:** Redux and React is new to me but since I am trying to build a Expense Manager, using a state management library like redux is trivial.

### Day 1: August 06, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Added test cases to test Reducers, Actions, Store and Components using Jest.

**Thoughts**: Knowing how to write test cases for your app is important and it helps understand the flow of your app and makes you rethink the processs.

### Day 3: August 07, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed writing test cases for all the components and functions using Jest.

**Thoughts** Writing test cases can be boring but helps make an application robust..
